# Week2_Assignments
This repository contains my week2 python assignments for AI/ML internship program. The tasks cover python fundamentals:

-Basic operations

-Lists and Numpy Arrays

-Dictonaries & Sets

Mini Project : prompt logger

Python Fundamentals for AI/ML

Task 1: Python Basics & Operators

*Create a Python script that accepts two numbers from the user.
*Perform all basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus, power).
*Demonstrate use of comparison and logical operators (>, <, ==, !=, and, or, not).
*Print results clearly using formatted output (f-strings).

Task 2: Lists and Arrays

Create a list of 10 random integers.
Perform the following operations:
* Add and remove elements. 
* Find the maximum and minimum values. 
* Sort the list.
Convert the list into a NumPy array and calculate:
  * Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation.

Task 3: Dictionaries and Sets

* Create a dictionary named student with keys: name, course, marks.
* Add a new key grade and assign a value based on marks (e.g., A/B/C).
* Print all keys and values using a loop.
* Create two sets of AI tools

Task 4: File Handling

* Create a text file named ai_students.txt.
* Write details of at least 5 students (name, marks, grade).
* Read the file and display students who scored above 75 marks.

Task 5: Real-World Mini Project 

* Create a Python program named ai_prompt_logger.py that:
* Accepts a user input (simulating an AI prompt).
* Saves the prompt text in a file named prompt_history.txt.
* Each time you run the program, new prompts are appended with timestamps.
